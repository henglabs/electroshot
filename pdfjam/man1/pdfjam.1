.SH "CONFIGURATION FILES"

Configuration of the PDFjam utilities 
involves specifying the location of pdflatex,
the location of temporary files, specification of default page size,
etc.  This is done in a block of lines near the top of the pdfjam script; 
settings made there are over-ridden by any that
are found at a site-wide configuration file 
(at /etc/pdfjam.conf, 
/usr/share/etc/pdfjam.conf, /usr/local/share/pdfjam.conf, or
/usr/local/etc/pdfjam.conf), which
in turn are over-ridden by any that are found in a user-defaults
file at ~/.pdfjam.conf\&.
