.SH "DESCRIPTION" 
.PP 
pdfflip reflects (left-right) the pages of files in the Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF)\&.  
.PP
If no source PDF file ('SRC') is specified, input
is from /dev/stdin. If 'PAGESPEC' is omitted, all pages are processed.
.PP
Source files are processed sequentially into a single output
unless the '--batch' option is used, in which case they are processed 
separately.
.PP 
pdfflip operates on one or more PDF files, and (either with the '--batch' 
option or with '--outfile DIR' where 'DIR' is a directory) the 
resulting files have
the suffix '-flipped' applied to their names by default.  To change 
the suffix,
use the '--suffix' option, for example
.PP
.RS
.B    pdfflip --suffix 'reflected' --batch myfile1.pdf myfile2.pdf
.RE
.PP 
will result in files named 'myfile1-reflected.pdf' and 'myfile2-reflected.pdf'.
